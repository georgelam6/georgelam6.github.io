		<p><b>Untitled Game Project</b></p>

		<p>This was a sidescrolling shooter game that me and a friend were working on for the Australian STEM Video Game Challenge (which is a game jam run through schools where small teams compete to create a playable game in an engine of choice). Unfortunately, the jam was cancelled due to Covid-19, so we never finished the game</p>
		<p>We decided to use Godot as our engine of choice, and I did almost all of the programming and game logic for the game.</p>

		<p><b>Code Samples</b></p>
		<p>This game was for a game jam, so I was writing code on a time limit, meaning a lot of it is a little too messy to show.</p>
