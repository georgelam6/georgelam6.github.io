		<p>My favourite language is C, but I'm profficent in C++, C# and Python as well. I can do web development, too, but I don't enjoy it very much. At the moment I'm building a standalone, single-header game framework in C. Soon it will be enough to make a simple game (I plan to create an ASCII roguelike with it), I just need to add mouse input and audio. I like to program things from scratch, I love figuring out how things work under the hood (partly why C is my favourite language)</p>
