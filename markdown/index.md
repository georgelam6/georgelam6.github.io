Home page of George Lamb, student and programmer

My favourite language is C, and I'm proficient in C++, C#, Python and web technologies as well. At the moment I'm building a standalone, single-header game framework in C. I like to program things from scratch and I love figuring out how things work under the hood (partly why C is my favourite language)
