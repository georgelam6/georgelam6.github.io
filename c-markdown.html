<p>Mar 2021</p>
<p>Recently, I took it upon myself to create a static site generator in order to improve my personal website, without needing to create HTML templates that need to be copied and pasted. I wanted a simple, fast and lightweight site generator that would take a bunch of pages in the form of markdown and generate HTML from them.</p>
<p>In the end, I came out with a generator that will render this site in less than a millisecond, and supports all the essential features of markdown. <a class="link" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgelam6/georgelam6.github.io/master/generator.c">Here is the complete code for it</a>.</p>
<h2>Why C?</h2>
<p>Some might argue that C isn't really the best language to use for creating a markdown parser, and I would agree. Many "modern" languages have features such as build-in string manipulation that make a task such as this extremely easier. However, I like C, I find it a very nice language to use. And I wanted to brush up on my pointer arithmetic a bit, since string manipulation is quite heavy in that department.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>I didn't end up implementing every markdown feature, rather, I only implemented the ones that I anticipated needing for this site in the near future. This includes headers, paragraphs, links, lists and images, as well as bold and italic text.</p>
<h2>Algorithm overview</h2>
<p>The way I chose to implement this algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Loop over the lines of markdown.</li>
<li>Check to see if the line starts with any hash-tags, indicating a header.</li>
<li>Check to see if the line starts with a "-" character, indicating a list.</li>
<li>Iterate the characters in the line, parsing links, images, bold and italics.</li>
<li>Output HTML accordingly.</li>
</ul><h2>Parsing headers</h2>
<p>This is quite simple. First, a check is carried out to see if the current line begins with a hashtag. Then, the number of hashtags after that are counted to check what header tag should be used, eg. Two hashes is a <code>&lt;h2></code> tag, three is a <code>&lt;h3></code>, etc.</p>
<h2>Parsing lists</h2>
<p>This actually took me quite a while to figure out. Checking to see if the line begins with a "-" and inserting a <code>&lt;li></code> tag is easy, it's a similar process to parsing headers. The problem arises with adding the corresponding <code>&lt;ul></code> and <code>&lt;/ul></code> tags in the correct places. Ideally we want them at the start and end of a list, not around each element, meaning the algorithm has to look back on itself to see if it should insert the ending <code>&lt;/ul></code> tag.</p>
<p>I did this by storing the previous line as well as the current line while iterating the markdown file. This way, whenever a new line is encountered, we can check if it is a list item and if the previous line was a list item. If the previous line is a list item and the current one isn't, we know it's the end of a list and can insert the <code>&lt;/ul></code> tag.</p>
<h2>Parsing links & images</h2>
<p>Parsing links and images is fairly straighforward, once you know how to get the characters between two other characters. The markdown for a link is shown here:</p>
<p><code>[amazing link](www.address.com)</code></p>
<p>It needs to be converted into this HTML form:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a href="www.address.com">amazing link&lt;/a></code></p>
<p>The way I did this was by iterating each paragraph one character at a time. Yes, this is bad for performance, but since the characters are grouped in memory, the program can make efficient use of cache, so the performance hit isn't too great. When a <code>[</code> is encountered, we start recording the text until the next <code>]</code> character, giving us the link's display text. After that, we look for the corresponding <code>(</code>, which should come exactly after the <code>]</code>. Then, we record everything until the next <code>)</code>, which gives us the string of where the link should link to. Then, we can easily generate an HTML string via. <code>sprintf</code>.</p>
<p>The algorithm for images is almost identical. The only exception is that there is a <code>!</code> before the first <code>[</code>, and the image's alt-text is between the square brackers, and the the image's source is between the round brackets.</p>
<h2>Things to consider</h2>
<p>This markdown parser is no where near complete. It doesn't have support for many widely used features of markdown, here are a couple of common ones that you may need to implement for your markdown renderer:</p>
<ul><li>Tables</li>
<li>Nested lists</li>
<li>Code snippets</li>
<li>Block quotes</li>
<li>Horizontal rules</li>
</ul></ul><p>You will find that most of these are fairly trivial to implement. Others, however, such as tables and nested lists, are much more difficult.</p>
